# ERP Management System



The ERP Management System is a C++ application that provides a comprehensive platform for managing and accessing information within an educational institution. The system is designed to have two distinct user roles: administrator and student. The administrator has privileges to modify and update various details, while students have access to view specific information related to their academic pursuits.

Key Features of the ERP Management System:

- Administrator Functionality:
  - Faculty Management: The administrator can add, update, and delete faculty members' details, including their names, contact information, and departments.
  - Course Management: The administrator can manage the courses offered by the institution. This includes adding new courses, modifying existing courses, and assigning faculty members to specific courses.
  - Student Enrollment: The administrator can enroll new students by entering their details, assigning them to specific departments, and maintaining records of their course registrations.
  - System Configuration: The administrator has the ability to configure system settings, such as the academic calendar, semester schedules, and important announcements.

- Student Functionality:
  - Faculty Information: Students can access information about the faculty members in their respective departments, including their names, areas of expertise, and contact details.
  - Course Availability: Students can view the list of courses available for their department, along with their course codes, descriptions, and schedules.
  - Academic Calendar: Students can access the academic calendar, which includes important dates such as registration periods, examination schedules, and holidays.
  - Personal Information: Students can view and update their personal details, such as contact information, address, and emergency contact information.

The ERP Management System aims to streamline administrative tasks and provide students with easy access to relevant information. By leveraging the capabilities of C++, the system ensures efficient data management and a user-friendly experience for both administrators and students.
